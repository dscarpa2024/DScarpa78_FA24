### Introduction
The Palmer penguins dataset is about three different species of penguins that live in a colony in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. It contains information about the penguins' body measurements, like beak length and depth, flipper length, and body mass. It also has information about the sex and age of the penguins.

 
```{python}
#| label: libraries
#| include: false


import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import plotly.express as px

!pip install palmerpenguins
!pip install setuptools

```

```{python}
#| label: project-data
#| code-summary: Read and format project data
# Include and execute your code here



from palmerpenguins import load_penguins
from lets_plot import *

LetsPlot.setup_html(isolated_frame=True)

penguins = load_penguins() #Loading the dataset
penguins.head() #shows the first 5 rows

```


### Elevator Pitch

#### The analysis shows clear differences in BODY MASS and FLIPPER LENGHT among the three penguin species.Gentoo Penguins: They are the largest in body mass. Adelie and Chinstrap Penguins: They have similar sizes.

    labels={

        "body_mass_g": "Body Mass (g)",

)

fig.show() # Display the chart

```

#### This graph shows the relationship between flipper length (flipper_length_mm) and body mass (body_mass_g) of three species of penguins: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo.
